Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good): I've made almost all the jams on the website successfully.

What you are making?
A motion sensor, which detects movement/presence of people around/fire too! I detects infrared rays.
Inspiration:
help from Charlie and Thomas, research in 5-10 articles in a magazine
Sketches (if they exist) (paper works): Not able to upload here, sorry.

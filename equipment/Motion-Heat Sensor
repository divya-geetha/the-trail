Is this your first PCB rodeo? (if yes, don't feel bad. you're all good):
I've done almost all the PCB jams on the website
What you are making?
I'm making a motion sensor (finished the design!), which uses a PIR sensor to detect infrared ray, heat/warmth from a body and produces a sound. It could be an awesome safety addition.

Inspiration:
It took some reccomendations from Thomas and Charlie and researched a bit online.
Sketches (if they exist) (paper works):
